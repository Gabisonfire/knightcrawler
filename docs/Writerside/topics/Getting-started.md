# Getting started

Knight Crawler is provided as an all-in-one solution. This means that you can get started with very little setup.

In its initial state Knight Crawler will only work on the machine that you host it on, and will not be accessible on
your local network or from the internet. This is a Stremio limitation ([read Stremio's stance here](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/687)) and is beyond our control. We provide a guide
how to make Knight Crawler accessible from your local network or the internet [here]().

## Before you start

Make sure that you have:
- A place to host Knight Crawler
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account _(optional)_
