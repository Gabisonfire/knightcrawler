# External access



In its initial state Knight Crawler will only work on the machine that you host it on, and will not be accessible on
your local network or from the internet. This is a Stremio
limitation ([read Stremio's stance here](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/687)) and is beyond our
control. We provide a guide
how to make Knight Crawler accessible from your local network or the internet [here]().
